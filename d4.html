		    		<p>The addition of sonic, vocal layers to an archival collection, whether documentary (as in the case of photographs and performance recordings) or narrative (storytelling), contributes meaningfully to what Linda Morra calls the &ldquo;affective economies&rdquo; (after Sara Ahmed) of the archive, which are &ldquo;shaped by the effects of encounters . . . and by reorientation(s) between subject and object&rdquo; (2). As Jason Camlot observes in Phonopoetics (2019), hearing a recording of a subject in an archival setting can also be a &ldquo;strangely real&rdquo; encounter, developing &ldquo;an experience of real-time processing&rdquo; that few other media can reproduce (3).</p> 
					<p>The sensory aspects of sound in the archives have the potential to create a sense of proximity not commonly found in conventional textual archives, which are generally imagined to be near-silent spaces for monastic contemplation. Building a sense of closeness and immediacy between the archive user and the research object or subject, sound recordings generate new forms of intimacy and connection, enabling the user to access nuanced details otherwise obfuscated or overlooked in conventional literary archives. This panel invites presenters to consider the 'strangely real' aspects of sound files and recordings in research or artistic production in artist or arts archives, particularly in (re)constituting subjectivity and personhood in the archive.</p>

		    		<h3>D.4.1 <i>Listening Together/Apart: Sound as (Affective) Pandemic Archival Medium</i></h3>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Emily Collins</strong><span class="school">, York University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>Sound recordings are important additions to cultural heritage in documenting histories and personal evidence, but they are often viewed as supplementary adjuncts to archival projects and practice. This subjugation to the primacy of the visual extends to the arts, humanities, and social sciences more broadly, and yet many scholars argue that sound (with its attendant listening) is an especially critical medium for cultivating different modes of attention, affective relations, ways of producing knowledge, and attuning to neglected histories (Gershon 2013; Goh 2017; Hagood 2019; Peterson and Brennan 2020). When the COVID-19 global pandemic hit, news reports and studies throughout the world began citing drastic reductions in noise pollution in urban centres, AI recordings of cellphone coughs, shifting soundscapes at home from new routines and work settings, and sonic sensitivities cultivated in quarantine and isolation. In response to this wealth of sonic research and information, an outpouring of calls &ndash; academic, artistic, and research-based &ndash; for sound recordings and contributions to digital archival sound projects followed.</p>
						<p>This paper considers the surge in archival activities foregrounding sound during the pandemic and the ways in which sound can be used as both a critical medium and a way to generate intimacy and proximity in moments of seclusion, uncertainty, and despair. Through an analysis of projects, including The Pandemic Sensory Archive, Sounds of Pandemia, and #StayHomeSounds, I position sound as a key medium for archival practice which generates not only a sense of embodied reality but also gestures towards new possibilities in digital contexts where sound represents a vector for imagination, immersion, and collective belonging in otherwise surreal, detached, and disconnected situations. In these online, mediated spaces where worlds intensely collide and conflate, and users become flattened out and disembodied, I argue that new configurations of personhood and subjectivities emerge through new forms of affective archival sonic engagements.</p>

		    		<h3>D.4.2 <i>Forced Migration: Bison stories and what they can tell settlers about a past, present, and future on stolen land</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Michelle Wilson</strong><span class="school">, University of Western Ontario</span></p>
		    		<p>There are sounds in the archive, and there are also silences. For everything we can hear or read in an archive, there are just as many questions about what has not been included and who has been left out. In this presentation, Michelle Wilson discusses her research-creation practice and commitment to audio work as a form of scholarship through the example of her interactive textile map, Forced Migration. In this work, Wilson stitches together organic and technological material to memorialize specific bison killed, captured, or bred in an effort to save the species from extinction. Each silver thread in the work honours one of the bison captured and controlled in this conservation effort. When viewers touch these strands, it triggers a corresponding audio story; not a straightforward narrative but a glimpse at the places, beings (human and non-human) and tales that have shaped our current relationships with bison. Wilson embraces a ficto-critical approach to archival records in these audio artworks to produce an embodied, speculative history of a familial line of bison. With the help of sound designer Angus Cruikshank and poet S&iacute;le Englert, Wilson has developed a collage of critically interpreted stories that open a listener's empathetic imagination. These stories strive to grapple with colonialism's impacts and give voice to the more-than-human characters at the heart of the research. Additionally, Wilson will discuss two different modalities she has used to disseminate this work, first in the exhibition GardenShip and State at Museum London and second as an episode of the literary podcast <i>SpokenWeb</i>.</p>

    				<p class="bio"><strong>Michelle Wilson</strong> is an artist and mother currently residing as an uninvited guest on Treaty Six territory in London, Ontario. In the Euro-American archive, the bodies of other animals are used to convey colonial knowledge systems. Their stories of survival are used to perpetuate myths of &quot;settler saviours.&quot; As a feminist of settler descent working in colonial institutions, this is the legacy that Wilson has inherited and is confronting. She successfully defended her Ph.D. dissertation, <i>Remnants, Outlaws, and Wallows: Practices for Understanding Bison</i> in May 2022 at the University of Western Ontario.</p>

		    		<h3>D.4.3 <i>Room Tones &ndash; Bodily responses to building and auditing the (sound) archive</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Debashis Sinha</strong><span class="school">, Toronto Metropolitan University</span></p>
    				<p>In my presentation, I offer my own experiences working with a growing archive of sound (and sound responses) that have a genesis in personally collected field recordings from Kolkata, India. There has been a growing shift in the practice of field recording to accept first-person perspective in the act of recording, where the presence of the recordist is understood and sometimes highlighted in the collection and apprehension of the material. Alongside and extending from this shift (and embedded in my own practice) is also the performative focus of building the sound archive &ndash; that recording can and further should be intimately connected to impulse, desire, instinct rather than be an extractive data gathering exercise. The resulting recordings hold power and embed intention that then engenders further interventions based on the story of the moment of recording, inventions which are connected bodily to the material in a deep and authentic way. Ultimately, accepting the presence and actions of the archive-gatherer as a vector of information in the resulting material allows for a wider range of response on the part of the researcher, as well as confirming as valid methods of research that broaden the field of archive studies in general.</p>
					<p>I argue that recording, intervening in, and auditing recordings made in this way prioritize practices of mindfulness, respect, and care in archive building, and allow us to apprehend our own (and others&rsquo;) materials in deeper ways, beyond assumptions of the archive as solely repositories of hard data or information.</p>

    				<p class="bio">Driven by a deep commitment to the primacy of sound in creative expression, <strong>Debashis Sinha</strong> has created numerous audio-centred solo and collaborative projects across Canada and internationally. Sound design and composition credits include works for contemporary dance, video, film, and award-winning productions with many of Canada&rsquo;s premiere stage companies, including longstanding artistic relationships with Peggy Baker Dance Projects, the Stratford Festival, Soulpepper Theatre Company, and others. His speculative mythology-driven sound practice has led to live appearances at MUTEK Japan, NeurIPS 2020, the Guelph Jazz Festival, the Banff Centre, ISEA, Akademie der K&uuml;nste, FILE Festival and others with exhibitions online, on records and in gallery spaces. His current research stream concentrates on sound production using machine learning and AI with an ear to uncovering new modes and methods of story creation and cultural transmission.

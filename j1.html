		    		<p>From drastically reducing the cost burden of course materials to directly involving students in the production of knowledge as active participants, Open Educational Resources (OERs) offer numerous pedagogical possibilities. This workshop will introduce participants to CanadARThistories, a free online course shell and contributor-based collection of object essays, and explore the potential of OERs to transform the ways that histories of Canadian and Indigenous art are taught.</p>
					<p>Beginning with a discussion of &quot;open&quot; education, participants will explore how to remix and revise open resources to generate course content and assessments that better suit instructor and student needs. By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to: identify OER materials, adopt and/or adapt them into their own teaching practices, and gain familiarity with Pressbooks. This workshop is particularly useful for new instructors and contract academic staff interested in using open materials in course design, as well as for university departments that are considering including Canadian art courses in their curriculum.</p>

    				<p>I have worked at the ROM for nearly four years now (the last two under pandemic restrictions and intermittent closures), and have come to realise the number of challenges ahead of me in making the collections more accessible and the displays more impactful for museum audiences. Many of the issues stem from the architecture of the gallery itself and the design choices taken in exhibiting the artefacts to accommodate the building&rsquo;s structure. Other issues are tied to curatorial decisions on the themes and approaches selected for the displays, including planning a gallery of the Middle East as opposed to a gallery of the Islamic world. In this paper, I will share my experiences of reinstalling a brand-new gallery of the Islamic World at the British Museum in 2018 and discuss some of my current strategies for potential ways forward at the ROM.</p>

    				<p class="bio"><strong>Fahmida Suleman</strong> is Curator of the Islamic World collections at the ROM and has over 14 years&rsquo; experience in curating exhibitions and museum displays, collections care and acquisitions, and public and institutional engagement.

She is also Assistant Professor (status only/non-budgetary cross appointment) at the University of Toronto and Adjunct Professor at Queen&rsquo;s University. She teaches courses and publishes on museum displays of Islamic art and material culture and topics on Islamic iconography.

		    		<h3>I.1.2 <i>Reflections on Teaching with Online Museum Collections: Challenges and Opportunities</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter">Ruba Kana&rsquo;an<span class="school">, University of Toronto</span></p>
    				<p>The recent wave of building new specialized museums of &ldquo;Islamic Art&rdquo; and the re-installation of &ldquo;Islamic Art&rdquo; galleries in several major international museums was mostly accompanied by public-facing museum websites. These websites proved to be a rich resource for teaching introductory and survey courses of &ldquo;Islamic art&rdquo; as they provide high-quality images and accessible information about the collections as well as a selection of each museum&rsquo;s prized objects. This article brings together first-hand observations on the challenges and opportunities of teaching with these online museum collections highlighting the uneven regimes of representation in museums of what is &ldquo;Islamic art&rdquo;, its regional assignations, taxonomies, as well as naming and labeling systems. The article also addresses the pedagogical implications of the architectures and affordances of online collections.</p>

    				<p>How does one teach the arts of premodern multi-ethnic and multi-faith societies in a contemporary Canadian context when discussions of multiculturalism unintentionally encourage a conflation of past and present experiences and realities? This talk topples with this highly complex and challenging question with a specific focus on the arts of the Islamic world, which were not only produced in multi-ethnic and multi-faith settings, but were also widely circulated in Christian Europe. I argue that one dynamic that makes this question so challenging is a romanticized reimagination of the past as a golden age that embodies the solutions to the problems we are facing today. The talk presents a series of practical interventions I have developed over the years and hopes to encourage further discussion beyond the field of Islamic Art History.</p>

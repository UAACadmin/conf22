		    		<p>Due to lack of clear definitions of ethics in research-creation practices, many funding and educational institutions rely on Tri-Council policies developed from a social science and humanities perspective, leaving gaps and foggy edges in protocols for visual arts practitioners. Within this atmosphere, we are posing questions for discussion: What are the important ethical guide posts in our field? How do we define responsible practices within a studio based and/or public context? In a more than human world? Are ethics individual to particular situations, or are there collective protocols that might be put in place? We invite artists, curators, and educators to reflect on ethics and responsibility in the visual arts. This panel strives to bring together Indigenous and decolonial perspectives, case studies (whether looking at one&rsquo;s own practice or others), and educational best practices/approaches (from both educator and student perspectives).</p>

		    		<h3>C.6.1 <i>Feltness: radical relatedness, reciprocity, and care in research-creation</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Stephanie Springgay</strong><span class="school">, McMaster University</span></p>
		    		<p>This paper/presentation takes up questions of ethics in research-creation through the concept of <i>feltness</i>. Feltness has various entry points including: the textile process of hand felting; affect theory and feelings; the material and embodied experience of being in the world; queer-feminist theories of touching encounters; and feminist materialist conceptualizations of more-than-human entanglements. Feltness or intimacy conjures radical relatedness, reciprocity, and care.</p> 
					<p>Intimacy is conventionally described as closeness, affinity, attachment, and familiarity. As feltness &ndash; relationality and reciprocity - intimacy, becomes a mode of invention and creation that proliferates indeterminately and affectively. This is an ethics of care that is uncomfortable and perplexing and does not place human mastery at the centre. In articulating research-creation as a practice of intimacy, I am holding space to be touched by the thinking-making-doing of research-creation, as well as the bodies (human and non-human) that co-compose the research encounter.</p> 
					<p>As a practice of intimacy research-creation recognizes that everything is in relation, indeterminate, and constantly forming. However, it is crucial that we ask complex questions about what it means to be in relation; to be intimate: <i>How are relations composed and sustained over time? How are all bodies in relation being accounted for, attuned to, and offered something for their contribution/labour of being in relation?</i> Opening space for the production of intimacy demands that we are response-able to the formation of relations. Intimacy stems from an awareness of the efforts it takes to cultivate relatedness in difference. Research-creation for me, has become a question of how to work ethically and in <i>intimate relation</i> with diverse publics.</p>
					<p>In thinking ethics of research-creation as feltness, I attune to a number of research-creation events that were collaboratively co-produced between researchers, artists, students and teachers over a decade as part of <i>The Pedagogical Impulse</i>. The research-creation projects take up questions and matters regarding socially-engaged art, research-creation, and radical pedagogy in post-secondary institutions, as well as elementary and secondary schools in North America. The various exemplifications explore the how of research-creation as an ethics and politics committed to queer-feminist, anti-racist and anti-colonial intimate practices.</p>

		    		<h3>C.6.2 <i>To be tied together</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Sheri Osden Nault</strong><span class="school">, University of Western Ontario</span></p>
    				<p>On the question of ethics as a queer M&eacute;tis arts practitioner, community member, and educator; most critically, none of these things is separate from the other. My identity and positionality, and my commitment to social justice, are through-lines in my life and creative practice.</p>
					<p>Beginning with a brief overview of my own positionality and research-creation, I propose to situate as a necessary (though not uncomplicated) ethical guidepost that <strong>each of us is in ongoing entangled relationship with the beings around us and, as such, must strive to be in caring community with these human and non-human beings</strong>.</p> 
					<p>To exemplify my point, I will discuss the pervasive cynical attitude that humans are inherently destructive and harmful to one another and the environment. This supposition relies on the harmful colonial fantasy of an &lsquo;untouched wilderness&rsquo; which erases the historic presence of Indigenous peoples on Turtle Island (and elsewhere) as well as our important symbiotic role in our environments. There is not and has never been a place of &lsquo;pure,&rsquo; &lsquo;untouched,&rsquo; and therefore implicitly &lsquo;unharmed&rsquo; Nature. Humans are also nature. The planet is a complex and adaptive system which can process a certain amount of impact. We have already affected the planet and will continue to. So, we must imagine ways forward that acknowledge this.</p>
					<p>This framework offers an alternative to the hopelessness and sense of overwhelm that stems from knowing we must live and work within often harmful systems and institutions, and that each of us will inevitably cause harm. It is possible and worthwhile to strive to be in responsible relationship, while also accepting that we will make mistakes. Further, the impacts of our actions are not final and it is our ongoing responsibility, as individuals within entangled interspecies community, to strive to act with care and rigour.</p>

					<p class="bio">Their art considers embodied connections between human and non-human beings, land-based relationships, and kinship sensibilities as an Indigenous Futurist framework. Methodologically, they prioritize tactile ways of knowing and sharing knowledges, the wisdom of lived experience, and learning from more than human kin. Their research is grounded in their experiences as Michif, n&ecirc;hiyaw, and Two-Spirit, and engages with decolonizing methodologies, queer theory, ecological theory, disability justice, speculative fiction, and intersectional and Indigenous feminisms.</p>

		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Kellyann Henderson &amp; Erienne Rennick</strong><span class="school">, Memorial University of Newfoundland Grenfell Campus</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>How can we as artists and educators invite all walks of life to our works, and what does it look like to approach that question with a collaborator. Through exploring the limitations on opportunities in our own lives as creators, through the lens of poverty and neurodivergence we reflect on the lived experience of being &ldquo;difficult&rdquo;, &ldquo;hard to digest&rdquo; and &ldquo;distractions&rdquo;. This allows us a freedom in collaboration that we honor by centering inclusivity for all - in a way that welcomes the inherent differences among us (to be in love with the inherent differences among us).</p> 
					<p>By applying autoethnographic research to our creative partnership as it unfolds in real time requires being open and honest in both the moments of friction as well as the bliss of a successful workday. As we create this work (an interactive playhouse combining adult play tables, and reflections of a friendship) we open the discussion around the ethics of intertwining two creative practices in a way that celebrates the individual goals and motivations of two distinct artists, while reflecting on the responsibilities we have to others.</p>
					<p>How can collaborative art making build a community by honoring the net of others it takes to make any interactive artwork possible. This is an effort to shift the art participant through the principals outlined of Pedagogy of the Oppressed as cocreators opposed to empty vessels, as much as a reflection on the deep friendships that foster a successful co-operation.</p>

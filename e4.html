		    		<p>What exactly is a voice? This session invites submissions from scholars and practitioners exploring the vocative dimension and its role in the arts from all cultures and time periods. 
Critical writing on the voice comprises a marginal, yet highly motivated topic in the fine arts, comparative literature and philosophy. We hope to encourage a fruitful dialogue on the voice drawing upon a range of other disciplines and practices in the visual and performing arts including music, cinema, theatre, spoken-word performance, digital games and popular culture. Some issues to be engaged with may include (but are by no means limited to): the voice and aesthetic perception; the voice and critical theories of subjectivity (including sexual/gender, racial and/or ethnic identity); the voice in narration and oral testimonies; the &lsquo;acousmatics&rsquo; of the voice in cinematic diegesis and in film/video installation, and the function of VoIP communication in today&rsquo;s networked culture.</p>

		    		<h3>E.4.1 <i>People Talking: Conversation and Relation in Robert Ashley&rsquo;s Perfect Lives</i></h3>

    				<p>The voice has been productively theorized as inherently relational, as has sound itself: see the work of Adriana Cavarero, Nina Sun Eidsheim, and Brandon LaBelle. But in order to move towards a generative account of the vocal- or sonic-relational aesthetics of contemporary art, we must take into account the Bourriadian baggage that accompanies the term &ldquo;relational,&rdquo; and consider how the specificity of vocality, or conversational aesthetics, within recent art practices may change its terms&mdash;especially in the case of voices that are recorded, amplified, or otherwise technologically mediated. How do themes of relational ambivalence or inconvenience change the way we hear conversation in an aesthetic context?</p>
					<p>This paper moves towards answering this question by considering the (mediated) voice in relation within American composer Robert Ashley&rsquo;s opera-for-television Perfect Lives (1983). A seven-episode audiovisual odyssey set in the American Midwest, with a libretto is delivered in Ashley&rsquo;s signature speech-as-song vocal style, Perfect Lives is a paradigmatic effort from within the post-60s collaborative, multimedia American experimental art scene, entangled within experimental arts institutions and mass media alike. I briefly consider relationality in Perfect Lives from several angles, focusing on the episode &ldquo;The Bar&rdquo;: through its experimentally multivocal audiovisual performance, and through its &ldquo;ritual,&rdquo; or participatory, televisuality as theorized by Ashley. Conversation is here variously an egalitarian mode of performance and a mediatized&mdash;and frequently absurd&mdash;philosophical process. By hearing it both ways, can we also begin to hear (and see, and otherwise sense) a minor vocal relational aesthetic built around the challenges of conversation?</p>

Her dissertation examines conversational voice through the figure of song in experimental performance, installation, and video art from 1983 to the present. Using Robert Ashley&rsquo;s <i>Perfect Lives</i> as a paradigmatic case study, the dissertation considers Wynne Greenwood&rsquo;s <i>Tracy + the Plastics</i>, Moyra Davey&rsquo;s essay films, and the collaborative work of Wu Tsang and Fred Moten.

    				<p>Opera is memorialized in popular culture by a singular image: a fat lady in a horned helmet using her voice in ways most people never could. In <i>Don&rsquo;t Let the Fat Lady Sing! Body Politics in Opera</i>, we will examine modern opera ecology&rsquo;s reinforcement of broader society&rsquo;s systemically oppressive social structures and norms and its effect on singers. Conventional beauty standards, including the pursuit of thinness, have anti-Black origins. We aim to explore how the demand for these aesthetic norms in the industry impacts singers and their instruments, from the misunderstandings of the athleticism and capabilities of fat singers to the punishing of divergence from patriarchal gender norms, and the strict enforcement of Western aesthetic ideals informed by misogynoir. The human voice cannot be divorced from the body which it inhabits, and we will explore the ways in which these structures and norms silence the voices in bodies that do not fit the dominant aesthetic agenda.</p>

		    		<h3>E.4.3 <i>Which Voices in Experimental, Non-narrative VR Creation?</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Olivia McGilchrist</strong><span class="school">, Concordia University</span></p>
    				<p>My current research-creation project entitled: <i>Virtual ISLANDS</i> ties the relationship between Caribbean futures&mdash;as an alternative to Western techno-futurism (Lewis, 2014) and the possibility of submersion as a postcolonial stance within VR-making practice. Inspired by the geography of Caribbean insularity and the influence of this geography on Caribbean identities, my project is informed by the violent histories of transatlantic slavery, which I read through the framework of British scholar Paul Gilroy&rsquo;s notion of the Black Atlantic (1993) in dialogue with the notion of tidalectics developed by Barbadian scholar Kamau Brathwaite (1999). To counter the Western influence of the Hegelian dialectic of thesis/antithesis/synthesis, Brathwaite proposes a tidal poetics, or tidalectics, where the constant ebb and flow of the tides around Caribbean islands are constitutive to the philosophical framework around Caribbean identities.</p>
					<p>I will explore how the notion of a voice in VR creation is generative in relation to the theoretical questions which prompted the creation of <i>Virtual ISLANDS</i>:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Can an encounter with a virtual body which comes in and out of sight in VR address how the self and the other are represented in virtual space?</li>
						<li>Can VR as an experiential, artistic project versus narrative-led VR, suggest a different approach to the techno-solutionist assumptions at work, and what happens when VR is evoked as an empathy machine to address issues of identity, embodiment, gender, and race?</li>
					</ol>

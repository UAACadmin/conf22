		    		<p>Curating in public space necessitates a set of responsibilities for curatorial care. What possibilities are offered to places, participants, artists, and artworks when the curator is not the authority but alternately inhabits the position of carer and centers slow curation? Slow curation, according to scholar Johnson is a method that is context specific, relational, and collaborative, and is accountable to diverse communities (Johnson 26). Slow curation unsettles care and emphasizes an ethics of responsibility and accountability grounded in radical relatedness. This requires, as Puig de la Bellacasa writes, thinking of care beyond nature/culture binaries and settler colonial and anthropocentric morals (Puig de la Bellacasa 13).</p>
		    		<p>We invite conference papers and presentation proposals that explore slow curation as relational care including, but not limited to: Indigenous practices; decolonizing and anti-oppressive methodologies; place and ecological crisis; trauma and healing; time, duration, and the ephemeral; social practice and the shifting roles of audience, participant, and co-collaborator; questions about publicness.</p>

		    		<h3>H.1.1 <i>What Water Knows: Reflections on Curating the 2019 and 2022 Toronto Biennial of Art</i></h3>
		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants">Katie Lawson<span class="school">, Western University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p><i>What Water Knows: Reflections on Curating the 2019 and 2022 Toronto Biennial of Art</i> draws on a chapter authored for the recent major exhibition publication Water, Kinship, Belief. It takes up questions of curatorial methodology, analogous lessons from hydrology, and sustained engagement within an expansive network of collaborators. I worked alongside co-curators Candice Hopkins and Tairone Bastien on <i>The Shoreline Dilemma</i> and <i>What Water Knows, The Land Remembers</i>, the three of us aligned in our approach of curating as a process of attunement, and a process that is context-specific, relational, and collaborative.</p>
					<p>The Toronto Biennial of Art offered the rare opportunity for the same curatorial team to work together across both the first and second editions of the Biennial. This fostered a sustained engagement between curators with the city and its perpetually transforming communities and with the artists themselves. In the realm of Biennial and mega-exhibition making practices, it facilitated multi-year commissioning processes, supporting more iterative forms of production and allowing for reflection and re-evaluation in between the two Biennials.</p> 
					<p>Given that Toronto Biennial focuses on supporting new commissions, I understood my role as a part of the curatorial team to question the material impacts of artwork production, and to encourage practices of salvaging, material recycling and redistribution of matter in a city that is constantly in a state of flux and (re)development. It is not just the materials that go into artistic production that allow for thinking through the footprint of exhibition making, but also the spaces that are taken up as sites. The strategy of taking up vacated spaces is one of many when thinking expansively about how to work in and with the specificity of a place. How can the dispersed presence of a free, city-wide Biennial, allow varying publics to see this place in all of its complexities, to become curious, to question epistemological paradigms that have brought us to present day?</p>

		    		<h3>H.1.2 <i>Island Neighbours and Nations: Breathing together across the shared ocean through slow curation</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter">Toby Lawrence<span class="school">, Open Space</span></p>
    				<p>Throughout 2023, Open Space (Victoria, BC) will present a series of public art and in-gallery installations, residencies and events under the title <i>Wayfinders: the ones we breathe with</i>. Breathing together across the shared ocean&mdash;in cultural, environmental, and molecular exchange&mdash;<i>Wayfinders</i> recalls ancient way finding practices utilizing the stars, wind, water, and land markers to find paths across the sea and into the intertwined histories, practices, and contemporary lives of adjacent homelands, through the work of artists from island neighbours and nations across the Pacific Ocean. Three successive artist projects by Camille Georgeson-Usher (Galiano Island), Tanya Lukin Linklater (Kodiak Island), and L.uli Eshr&#257;ghi (S&#257;moa) anchor the series, each one coincidently the culmination of long-term ideas awaiting the right time and place. Stretched across a timeframe typically filled by three separate exhibitions, this elongated program simultaneously nurtures the relationships that led to the development of this series and leaves space for the Open Space programming committee to organically and intuitively build outward with interdisciplinary programming, looking locally to communities on Vancouver Island and across to Haida Gwaii and Hawai'i. Herein, <i>Wayfinders</i> reveals itself as slow curation. This intentional move focused through the framework of island neighbours and nations recognizes the depth and transfer of knowledge as activated through relationality&mdash;essential in breaking open western colonial strongholds within the discipline of curation, de-centring singular narratives within curation, and implementing responsibility beyond personal subjectivity and worldview. Such relationality further extends to the land, the cosmos, and ideas, while underscoring accountability and the dynamism by which learning takes place (Wilson 2008). As the curatorial lead for Wayfinders, I am tracing transoceanic throughlines made visible by way of conversations, connections, and deep listening. This paper will explore these interwoven threads and modes of practice.</p>

		    		<h3>H.1.3 <i>To Know Water</i></h3>
		    		<ul>
			    		<li class="participants">Maria Hupfield<span class="school">, University of Toronto Mississauga</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p>The projects I curate operate artist to artist and center on relationships respectfully alongside other Indigenous makers and thinkers navigating the USA/Canada colonial border. By focusing on relations and Indigenous kinship ties these projects work to strengthen connections directly, ethically and with accountability. For the proposed panel on curatorial care my contribution will be a performative presentation titled <i>To Know Water</i> in which I will highlight a selection of my curatorial projects leading up to my most recent project focused on the waterways in Toronto as the inaugural artist in residence with ArtworxTO and the City of Toronto. During this presentation I will share my various approaches for each exhibition as I navigated diverse protocols and how one lead to the next functioning as continuum and network of support grounded in trust. Relevant online content, book projects, and exhibitions catalogs for each will also be shared including the development of decolonial bio strategies for the artist to increase transparency and new language across diverse practices by Indigenous Makers. I will also share strategies on how I navigated protocols across institution, nation and community.</p>
					<p>Exhibitions to be discussed include: <i>#callresponse</i> (touring exhibition) 2017, grunt gallery; <i>Night on Neebahgeezis</i>, Nuit Blanche City of Toronto 2017; <i>The First Water is the Body</i>, Art Center of New Jersey 2021; <i>Coffee Break</i>, Vera List Center for Arts and Politics 2021-22; and my current research with the Indigenous Virtual Living Archive, Indigenous Creation Studio UTM.</p>
					<p>For this presentation performative actions linked to each project will be utilized to provide an engaging and lively exchange with the audience.

		    		<ul>
			    		<li class="participants">Janine Marchessault<span class="school">, York University</span></li>
		    		</ul>
    				<p><i>Archive/Counter-Archive</i> is a research-creation partnership involving over twenty archival organizations and cultural repositories for AV and other artist media in Canada. This project focuses on the challenges and generative opportunities afforded by diverse media archives belonging to Indigenous communities (First Nations, M&eacute;tis, Inuit),  Black communities, People of Colour, women, LGBT2Q+ and immigrant communities. Through artist residencies and creative counterarchives, we are calling attention to archival media most vulnerable to decay, disappearance and inaccessibility. This talk will focus in particular on artists engagements with decay, putrefaction and the regeneration of archival materials through performative forms of living entanglement.</p> 
					<p>New ecological approaches to artistic production and curation ask us to see relationships between nature and culture in terms of a broader continuum of entanglements  (rather than discrete temporalities and objects) which work to redefine history. My talk will engage with several recent site-specific exhibitions, artist residencies and creative methodologies tied to &ldquo;process cinema&rdquo; that helps reimagine sustainable cultures through the creation of dynamic encounters and slow-moving analogue media.</p>
